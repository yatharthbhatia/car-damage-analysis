The dataset includes 4049 images.
Damaged-parts are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 256x256 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -7 and +7 degrees
* Random shear of between -6째 to +6째 horizontally and -6째 to +6째 vertically
